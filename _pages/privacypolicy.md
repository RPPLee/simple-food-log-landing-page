# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: October 15, 2025**

## Introduction

Right Path Programming, LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates the Simple Food Log mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our App.

**Your privacy is important to us.** Simple Food Log is designed with privacy in mind - all your data stays on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on external servers.

## Developer Information

**Developer:** Lee Benson Martin
**Company:** Right Path Programming, LLC
**Address:** 3532 Savannah Park Lane, Vestavia Hills, Alabama 35216
**Contact Email:** rightpathprogramming@gmail.com
**Website:** [https://lbm54.github.io/simple-food-log-landing-page/](https://lbm54.github.io/simple-food-log-landing-page/)

## Information We Collect

### Information Stored Locally on Your Device

Simple Food Log stores the following information **locally on your device only**:

1. **User Profile Information**
   - Your name
   - Your email address

2. **Food Log Data**
   - Text descriptions of what you ate
   - Notes about your meals
   - Dates and meal times
   - Photos of your food (stored in your device's local storage)

3. **Dietitian Contact Information** (Optional)
   - Dietitian name
   - Dietitian email address
   - Dietitian phone number

**Important:** All of this information is stored exclusively on your device using a local SQLite database. We do not have access to this data, and it is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not collect analytics data
- We do not track your location
- We do not access your contacts
- We do not collect device identifiers for advertising
- We do not create user accounts on external servers

## How Your Information is Used

The information stored on your device is used solely for the following purposes:

1. **Display Your Food Logs** - To show you your meal history and notes
2. **Generate PDF Reports** - To create shareable reports of your food logs
3. **Send Reports via Email** - To email PDF reports to your dietitian (only when you explicitly choose to do so)
4. **Personalize Your Experience** - To display your name in the app interface

## Data Sharing and Transfers

### Voluntary Sharing by You

The only way your data leaves your device is when **you explicitly choose** to share it:

- **Email Sharing:** When you use the "Send to Dietitian" feature, the App generates a PDF report and uses your device's email client to send it to the email address you specify. This uses your device's configured email service (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.).
- **System Share Sheet:** When you use the "Share" feature, the App uses your device's native sharing functionality to share a PDF report through any app you choose (messaging apps, cloud storage, etc.).

We have no access to what you share or with whom you share it.

### Third-Party Services

**RevenueCat (In-App Purchases)**

We use RevenueCat to process in-app purchases for premium features. RevenueCat may collect:
- Transaction information related to your purchase
- Device information needed to process the transaction

RevenueCat's privacy practices are governed by their privacy policy: [https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy](https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy)

**Important:** RevenueCat does not have access to your food logs, photos, or personal notes.

## Device Permissions

Simple Food Log requests the following permissions:

### Camera (iOS and Android)
- **Purpose:** To take photos of your meals
- **Usage:** Photos are stored locally on your device and never uploaded to external servers

### Photo Library (iOS and Android)
- **Purpose:** To select existing photos from your device's photo library
- **Usage:** Photos remain on your device

### Microphone (iOS only)
- **Purpose:** Required by iOS when using the camera for video capture capabilities

You can manage these permissions through your device settings at any time.

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage Only

All your data is stored in:
- A local SQLite database on your device
- Local file storage for photos

There are no cloud servers, no remote databases, and no external data synchronization.

### Security Measures

- Data is protected by your device's operating system security
- Photos are stored in your device's secure app-specific storage area
- No data is transmitted over the internet except when you explicitly choose to share reports

### Data Backup

If you use device backup services (iCloud, Google Drive, etc.), your data may be included in those backups according to your device settings. These backups are governed by Apple's and Google's respective privacy policies.

## Data Retention and Deletion

### How Long We Keep Your Data

We don't keep your data - it lives only on your device for as long as you keep the App installed.

### Deleting Your Data

You can delete your data at any time:

1. **Delete Individual Logs:** Use the delete function within the App
2. **Delete All Data:** Uninstall the App from your device

When you uninstall the App, all data stored locally (logs, photos, settings) is permanently deleted from your device.

### No Account Recovery

Since all data is stored locally and we don't maintain user accounts, we cannot recover your data if you delete the App or lose your device. We recommend periodically exporting your logs if you want to keep a backup.

## Children's Privacy

Simple Food Log is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 has used the App, please contact us at rightpathprogramming@gmail.com.

## International Users

Simple Food Log is available worldwide. Since all data is stored locally on your device and we do not operate servers that collect user data, there are no international data transfers.

### GDPR (European Users)

If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. However, since we do not collect or process your personal data on external servers, most GDPR obligations do not apply. Your data remains under your control on your device.

### CCPA (California Users)

If you are a California resident, you have certain rights regarding your personal information. Since we do not collect, sell, or share your personal information with third parties, CCPA obligations related to data sales and sharing do not apply to Simple Food Log.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:
- Updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this policy
- Posting the new Privacy Policy on our website
- Providing an in-app notification (for material changes)

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

## Your Rights

- **Right to Access:** You can access all your data within the App at any time
- **Right to Deletion:** You can delete your data by deleting individual logs or uninstalling the App
- **Right to Correction:** You can edit your information within the App's settings
- **Right to Data Portability:** You can export your data as PDF reports

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control over your information.
